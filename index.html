    <p>1.What is the Difference between react and react native? Which one is library or framework?</p>
    <p>React and React Native are developed by Facebook and have gained a huge fan base in a short time. 
        React is known as ReactJs, which is a JavaScript library to build single-page web applications.

        Besides, React Native is a React JS-based framework to design mobile apps. Moreover, with reusable components, 
        you can develop native mobile applications.
        
        React is a JavaScript library of reusable components designed to create skeletons of the apps, whereas React 
        Native is designed to build native mobile apps with reusable components. React is an open-source JS library 
        for building the UIs for web applications; besides, React Native is used to build rich mobile UI from 
        declarative components using only JavaScript. Both React and React Native are ruling the industry and are 
        widely used for mobile and web applications. However, the difference between web apps vs websites will not
         affect your user.

    <p>2.What is the package name you are using for routing?</p>
    <p>React Router is a standard library system built on top of the React and used to create routing
         in the React application using React Router Package.In this Browser Router as Router, 
         Routes and Route and NavLink get imported from react-router-dom. React Router DOM enables you 
         to implement dynamic routing in a web app. Unlike the traditional routing architecture in which 
         the routing is handled in a configuration outside of a running app, React Router DOM facilitates 
         component-based routing according to the needs of the app and platform.

    <p>3.How do you switch/navigate form one component to another in React?</p>
    <p>
        Way to Switch/Navigate from one page to another page <br>

Link <br>

NavLink <br>

Redirect Component <br>

history.push <br>

history.replace <br>

Link Link is used to manage the navigation and it worked as an anchor tag. Check below code for the demonstration. import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'; ... ...

About <br>
NavLink NavLink behaves the same as Link but in addition, it comes with a new attribute called “activeClassName” which helps us to add the class to the anchor tag when page url will match.

import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom'; ... ... About

 <p>4.What is lazy loading in react ?</p>
<p> In essence, lazy loading means that a component or a part of code must get loaded when it is required. It is also referred to as code splitting and data fetching . Talking about React specifically, it bundles the complete code and deploys all of it at the same time.

    Example:An example of image lazy-loading can be found on the popular publishing platform Medium, which loads lightweight placeholder images at page load, and replaces them with lazily-loaded images as they're scrolled into the viewport. An example of image lazy-loading in action.
    
    Benefits: The benefits of lazy loading include: Reduces initial load time – Lazy loading a webpage reduces page weight, allowing for a quicker page load time. Bandwidth conservation – Lazy loading conserves bandwidth by delivering content to users only if it's requested.
</p>
<p>Difference b/w Stateful and stateless Component.</p>
<p>
    Stateless:
If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless we need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, we should go for function components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether.

Stateful:
If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These stateful components are always class components and have a state that gets initialized in the constructor. class App extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props) this.state = { count: 0 } }

  render() {
    // ...
  }
}
